# 📦 Delivery Time Estimation using Linear Regression

This project aims to estimate delivery time using Linear Regression based on various features from the dataset. It involves the following key steps:

## 📁 Files
- **LR_Delivery_Time_Estimation_Starter_YashJain.ipynb**  
  Main Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and coefficient comparison.
- **LR_Delivery_Time_Estimation_Starter_YashJain.md**  
  Markdown version of the notebook for documentation or review purposes.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Trained Linear Regression models on both scaled and unscaled features.
- Compared model coefficients to analyze feature importance.
- Used `sklearn` for model training and evaluation.
- Sorted coefficients by absolute impact to interpret top contributing features.

## 📚 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional for visualization)

## 🧪 How to Use
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to explore the data, train models, and interpret results.
3. Use the HTML or Markdown version for documentation or sharing.
